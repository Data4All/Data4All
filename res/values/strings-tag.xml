    <!-- description classified values highway -->
    <string name="description_highway_residential">Roads which are primarily lined with and serve as an access to housing.</string>
    <string name="description_highway_service">For access roads to, or within an industrial estate, camp site, business park, car park etc. Can be used in conjunction with service=* to indicate the type of usage and with access=* to indicate who can use it and in what circumstances.</string>
    <string name="description_highway_track">Roads for mostly agricultural or forestry uses. To describe the quality of a track, see tracktype=*. Note: Although tracks are often rough with unpaved surfaces, this tag is not describing the quality of a road but its use. Consequently, if you want to tag a general use road, use one of the general highway values instead of track.</string>
    <string name="description_highway_unclassified">The least most important through roads in a country\'s system – i.e. minor roads of a lower classification than tertiary, but which serve a purpose other than access to properties. (The word \'unclassified\' is a historical artefact of the UK road system and does not mean that the classification is unknown; you can use highway=road for that.) </string>
    <string name="description_highway_footway">For designated footpaths; i.e., mainly/exclusively for pedestrians. This includes walking tracks and gravel paths. If bicycles are allowed as well, you can indicate this by adding a bicycle=yes tag. Should not be used for paths where the primary or intended usage is unknown. Use highway=pedestrian for pedestrianised roads in shopping or residential areas and highway=track if it is usable by agricultural or similar vehicles.</string>
    <string name="description_highway_tertiary">The next most important roads in a country\'s system.</string>
    <string name="description_highway_path">A non-specific path. Use highway=footway for paths mainly for walkers, highway=cycleway for one also usable by cyclists, highway=bridleway for ones available to horses as well as walkers and highway=track for ones which is passable by agriculture or similar vehicles.</string>
    <string name="description_highway_secondary">The next most important roads in a country\'s system. (Often link smaller towns and villages.) </string>
    <string name="description_highway_primary">The next most important roads in a country\'s system. (Often link larger towns.) </string>
    <string name="description_highway_bus_stop">A small bus stop. Can be mapped more rigorously using public_transport=stop_position for the position where the vehicle stops and public_transport=platform for the place where passengers wait. See public_transport=* for more details.</string>
    <string name="description_highway_crossing">Pedestrians can cross a street here; e.g., zebra crossing </string>
    <string name="description_highway_turning_circle">A turning circle is a rounded, widened area usually, but not necessarily, at the end of a road to facilitate easier turning of a vehicle. Also known as a cul de sac.</string>

    <string name="description_highway_traffic_signals">Lights that control the traffic </string>

    <string name="description_highway_motorway_link">The link roads (sliproads/ramps) leading to/from a motorway from/to a motorway or lower class highway. Normally with the same motorway restrictions.</string>
    <string name="description_highway_street_lamp">A street light, lamppost, street lamp, light standard, or lamp standard is a raised source of light on the edge of a road, which is turned on or lit at a certain time every night.</string>
    <string name="description_highway_pedestrian">For roads used mainly/exclusively for pedestrians in shopping and some residential areas which may allow access by motorised vehicles only for very limited periods of the day. To create a \'square\' or \'plaza\' create a closed way and tag as pedestrian and also with area=yes.</string>
    <string name="description_highway_road">A road where the mapper is unable to ascertain the classification from the information available. This is intended as a temporary tag to mark a road until it has been properly surveyed. Once it has been surveyed, the classification should be updated to the appropriate value.</string>

    <!-- description classified values waterway -->
